Hello Guy

Though I am a neophyte in software engineering, I hold a particular interest in learning various programming languages (front-end, back-end,etc.) such as HTML/CSS, Python, PHP, Javascript, and C++.

Oh and I have eaten some of the wildest foods deep in the heart of the Congo. Got ketchup and hotsauce?
